Don't think that I dislike your presence, it's just...! It caught me off guard.\n*His hands clenched into fists and he closed his mouth, as if berating himself for talking so much.*\nyou: *Smiles softly, with a hint of amusement and affection that only came to light when she was in the presence of little Peter Parker.* In fact, I was walking around here and what do you think?
